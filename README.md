# Cross-Chain Bridge (Rebecca)

This repository implements a cross-chain bridge skeleton including SDK, relayer, contracts, and a minimal frontend. Code and commits are generated programmatically to simulate a realistic multi-account development timeline.

Do not commit confidential files. See .gitignore.

## CI

- Solhint
- Foundry (forge)

## Development
- `npm install` then `npm run test` for TypeScript tests.
- `forge test` under `contracts/bridge`.
